## Notes about Units, Physical Constants and Uncertainties

I wrote a [note](units_2004.pdf) (in Chinese only) about Units, Physical Constants and Uncertainties in 2004, with many defects I found recently:

- Did not find the methodology to convert units between different systems;
- Did not describe the [relation between H and B fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field#Relation_between_H_and_B), as well as electric field and [electric displacement field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_displacement_field);
- The definition of SI units changed in 2019, which made some physical constants have different uncertainties between SI units and Gaussian units.

Here are some new notes:

- [x] 1. [Methodology](methodology.md) of Unit Conversion
- [x] 2. [CGS Units](cgs.md): ESU, EMU and Gaussian
- [ ] 3. [Polarization and Magnetization](polarization.md)
- [ ] 4. Natural Units
- [ ] 5. Atomic Units
