## Notes to Units, Physical Constants and Uncertainties

I wrote a [note](units_2004.pdf) to Units, Physical Constants and Uncertainties in 2004, with many defects I found recently:

- Did not find a methodology to convert units between different systems;
- Did not describe the [relation between H and B field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field#Relation_between_H_and_B), as well as electric field and [electric displacement field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_displacement_field);
- The definition of SI units changed in 2019, which made some physical constants have different uncertainties between SI units and Gaussian units.

Here are some new notes:
