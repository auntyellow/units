## Introduction to Units, Physical Constants and Uncertainties

Although SI units are preferred in most publications, Gaussian and other units are still widely used in some fields, such as chapter 11-16 in [Jackson 1999](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_Electrodynamics_(book)). One reason is:

> Explicit factors of *c* appear in a natual manner in these units, making them more appropriate than SI units for relativistic phenomena.

Another reason is to make equations simpler, for example:

- Electromagnetic tensor: <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?F^{\mu\nu}={\begin{bmatrix}0&-E_x&-E_y&-E_z\\E_x&0&-B_z&B_y\\E_y&B_z&0&-B_x\\E_z&-B_y&B_x&0\end{bmatrix}"> (Gaussian, Heaviside-Lorentz, natural)
- Klein-Gordon equation: <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\left(\partial_t^2-\nabla^2+m^2\right)\psi(t,\mathbf{x})=0"> (natural)
- Schr√∂dinger equation for hydrogen atom: <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\left(-\frac{1}2\nabla^2-\frac{1}r\right)\psi=E\psi">
(atomic)

Conversions between different unit systems can be found in many textbooks (e.g. appendix in Jackson 1999). However, I'd like to provide a more straight-forward method to make the process easy to understand.

Because of [2019 redefinition of the SI base](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_redefinition_of_the_SI_base_units), the results here are different from other materials: there are uncertainties in most unit conversions between SI and Gaussian.
